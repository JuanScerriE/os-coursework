# CPS1012 Assignment

This repository contains the source code for all the tasks which
had to be completed for the CPS1012 assignment. CPS1012 is a
compulsory unit at the University of Malta which has to be
taken by first year Computer Science and Mathematics undergraduates
during the second semester.


## Build Instructions

`.gitignore` is being used to make sure that all the files being
generated by `cmake` during testing are not pushed to the
repository.

The minimum required version for `cmake` is `3.10` and the
minimum required version for `gcc` is `12`.

Starting from the root of the directory, execute the following commands.

```
cmake -S src -B build ; cd build ; make
```

This generates 7 executables. Which are the following:

```
Task 1  Task2   Task 3

./q1a   ./q2ab  ./tish
./q1c
./q1d
./q1e
```

To execute the following binaries you must be in the build
directory and type the following command where you must
substitute `{name_of_binary}` with one of the binaries described
above.

```
build $ ./{name_of_binary}
```

E.g.

```
build $ ./q2ab
build $ ./tish
```

## Testing

Each binary has a main method which allows it to be run and
tested with random user input to test if the expected behaviour
is observed.

Moreover, `valgrind` was used for profiling to ensure that no
memory is leaked.

## References

For this assignment I used the suggested line editing library
`linenoise`. The repository can be found at
